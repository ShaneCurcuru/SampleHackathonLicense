# SampleHackathonLicense
An example of a repo with a permissive license. Just copy the file called LICENSE into the top-level directory of your repo.

Alternately, [GitHub has their own help document](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/) on adding a license for your repo - it's **always** a good idea to have a license on your repo.
